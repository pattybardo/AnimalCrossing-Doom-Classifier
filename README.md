# AnimalCrossing-Doom-Classifier
This classifier is a fun project I picked up to gain some practical ML experience. This project is based off of [tensorflow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) aimed at transfer learning. 
The dataset and more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/doom-crossing).
